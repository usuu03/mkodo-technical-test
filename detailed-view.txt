Due to experiencing difficulties with the navigation dependencies,
I decided it would be best for me to write a covering letter on
how I would approach so that I do not waste any more time.

I would firstly implement a component called 'LotteryDrawDetail'. 
This component would receive the draw data as prop similar to how I 
did with the LotteryDrawList component. However, in this case I would 
pass the data as prop when navigating from the list view. I would use
the data to display all the draw numbers and the bonus ball in a clean and
organised layout. 


For navigation, I'd set up a stack navigator that allows transitioning
between the 'LotteryDrawList' and 'LotteryDrawDetail' components. When a user taps on 
a specific draw from the list, the app would navigate to the 'LotteryDrawDetail'
screen, passing the selected draw's data. This would allow a smooth and intuitive 
experience.

For styling, I would want to use a card-style layout for the numbers, with clear labels
for each number and then the bonus ball. I would also add a back button for easy navigation 
back to the list of draws.

If I had more time, I would have improved the detail view with additional 
features, like displaying the prize amount in a more prominent way or 
adding animations when transitioning between screens to improve the overall user experience.
